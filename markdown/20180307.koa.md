Expressive HTTP middleware framework for node.js to make web applications and APIs more enjoyable to write. Koa's middleware stack flows in a stack-link manner, allowing you to perform actions downstream then filter an manipulate the response upstream.

Only methods that are common to nearly all HTTP servers are interated directly into Koa's small ~570 SLOC codebase. This includes things like content nagotiation, normalization of node inconsistencies, reairection,and a few others.

Koa is no bundled with any middleware

## Insallation

Koa require __node v7.6.0__ or higher for ES2015 and async function support.

```
$ npm install koa
```

## Hello Koa

```js
const Koa = require('koa');
const app = New Koa();

//response

app.use(ctx = >{
    ctx.body = 'Hello Koa'
});

app.listen(3000);

```
